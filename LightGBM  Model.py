# 1. Load the data
# Make sure "parkinsons.data" has a header row matching the columns below.
# If the file doesn't have headers, you'll need to supply the columns names explicitly:
# For reference, the column names (as typically provided) are:
#
#   name, MDVP:Fo(Hz), MDVP:Fhi(Hz), MDVP:Flo(Hz), MDVP:Jitter(%), MDVP:Jitter(Abs),
#   MDVP:RAP, MDVP:PPQ, Jitter:DDP, MDVP:Shimmer, MDVP:Shimmer(dB), Shimmer:APQ3,
#   Shimmer:APQ5, MDVP:APQ, Shimmer:DDA, NHR, HNR, status, RPDE, DFA, spread1,
#   spread2, D2, PPE
#
# If your downloaded file does not have this header row, uncomment and pass these to `names=...`
# columns = [
#     "name","MDVP:Fo(Hz)","MDVP:Fhi(Hz)","MDVP:Flo(Hz)","MDVP:Jitter(%)","MDVP:Jitter(Abs)",

# 2. Inspect and clean the data
# Drop the 'name' column, since it's not a useful feature

# 4. Create and train the LightGBM model
# You can tune parameters such as num_leaves, n_estimators, learning_rate, etc.

X_test.columns = X_test.columns.str.replace(r'[,;:\[\]\{\}\"\']', '', regex=True)

# 5. Predictions and Evaluation
